# Source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency
 A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency or crypto for short) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership 
records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation 
of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership. It typically does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically 
not issued by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking 
systems. When a cryptocurrency is minted or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized. 
When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a 
public financial transaction database. Bitcoin, first released as open-source software in 2009, is the first decentralized cryptocurrency. 
Since the release of bitcoin, over 7,000 altcoins (alternative variants of bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies) have been created.

According to Jan Lansky, a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions:
1. The system does not require a central authority, its state is maintained through distributed consensus.
2. The system keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership.
3. The system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created. If new cryptocurrency units can be created, 
the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units.
4. Ownership of cryptocurrency units can be proved exclusively cryptographically.
5. The system allows transactions to be performed in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed. 
A transaction statement can only be issued by an entity proving the current ownership of these units.
6. If two different instructions for changing the ownership of the same cryptographic units are simultaneously entered,
the system performs at most one of them.

# Altcoins

Tokens, cryptocurrencies, and other types of digital assets that are not Bitcoin are collectively known as alternative 
cryptocurrencies, typically shortened to “altcoins” or “alt coins”.
The term is commonly used to describe coins and tokens created after Bitcoin such as Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Dogecoin,
and forks of Bitcoin like Bitcoin SV. Sometimes these coins and tokens are referenced by a more scatological term: "shitcoins". 
[non-primary source needed][unbalanced opinion?] Paul Vigna of The Wall Street Journal also described altcoins as 
“alternative versions of bitcoin” given its role as the model protocol for altcoin inventors. In October 2018, 
The Wall Street Journal created its own altcoin, called WSJCoin.

Altcoins often have underlying differences with Bitcoin. For example, Litecoin aims to process a block every 2.5 minutes, 
rather than Bitcoin's 10 minutes which allows Litecoin to confirm transactions faster than Bitcoin. Another example is Ethereum,
which has smart contract functionality that allows decentralized applications to be run on its blockchain.
Ethereum has the largest “following” of any altcoins that have tried to improve on Bitcoin and is the most actively used blockchain in the world.
Significant rallies across altcoin markets are often referred to as an “altseason”.

 A blockchain account can provide functions other than making payments, for example in decentralized applications or smart contracts.
In this case, the units or coins are sometimes referred to as crypto tokens (or cryptotokens).The conflicts between token and cryptocurrency 
remains unsettled. Cryptocurrencies are generally generated by their own blockchain like Bitcoin and Litecoin whereas tokens are usually issued 
within a smart contract running on top of a blockchain such as Ethereum.
